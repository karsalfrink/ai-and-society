# Homework: Collect an Image Dataset

## Background

When designing for machine learning, and specifically computer vision, it helps to learn to see the world as a machine. Now that you have a basic understanding of what it takes to train an image recognition model, it is time to go back into the field to collect a more targeted dataset that you can use to prototype with, and to evaluate the feasibility of you product idea.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise you will be able to collect a small-scale street-level image dataset, and label it for the purposes of training a model. 

## Instructions

-   Go outside and with a camera or your smartphone take photos of the various classes your envisioned product's model should be able to recognize
-   Collect an ample amount of images for each label -- ideally, as a group, you end up with around 25-50 images per label, but more may be better.
-   Also collect an equal amount of images for the "null" class (one that does not show the things you are interested in)
    -   Make sure these images are as varied as possible, so that the classifier will be very accurate at recognising this label (low false negatives / high true positives)
-   Download the images to your local computer
-   Label the images in the training set by putting each in a named folder for that label (i.e. class)
-   Upload the dataset to a cloud service for easy use during follow-up exercises

## Product

After completing this exercise you will have a dataset which you can use to train a model in Google Teachable Machine that approximates the model your envisioned responsible urban AI system will use.

## Follow-up

In the next week's session, you will pool your dataset with those of your group members, and use it to train and test a model.
