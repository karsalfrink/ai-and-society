# Workshop: Stakeholder Analysis

## Background

An important part of design is to think about the consequences of your implementation. You've already thought about stakeholders and the potential consequences of your project for them. Today we'll try to dive deeper by asking particular questions that help you think of more potential stakeholders and the potential effects your decisions will have on them.

## Learning Objectives

After the workshop, you will be able to identify more non-obvious stakeholders and separate them into different categories. You also will be able to reflect on the effects of your project on your potential stakeholders' lives.

## Instructions

1.  The canvas for this exercise is attached to this page 
2.  List Core / Direct / Indirect stakeholders
    -   Try to generate as many ideas about stakeholders as possible
        -   Use the materials you have collected and read a during previous week
        -   Use Google if new ideas pop up
        -   Put all interesting pieces on the board and use it to: 
            -   Identify stakeholders
            -   Find harms and benefits
            -   Use these notes but do not limit yourself if something will pop up during workshop
    -   Use the following questions to facilitate a discussion:
        -   "Who are all of the types of individuals or organizations who have a stake in your envisioned system?"
        -   "Who is directly affected if your implementation is successful?"
        -   "Who is indirectly affected if it is successful?"
3.  Briefly discuss why each stakeholder is either Core / Direct / Indirect
    -   Select at least 1-2 stakeholders from each group and discuss why you think they belong to this group.
    -   Use the following questions to facilitate a discussion:
        -   "As you list your stakeholders in order of priority, put the key person or actor who you want to solve the problem for at the top. This is your core user."
        -   "Direct stakeholders refer to individuals who interact directly with the [your] system."
        -   "Indirect stakeholders refer to all other individuals who are otherwise affected by the use of the system."
4.  Discuss Benefits for each stakeholder
    -   Use the following questions to facilitate a discussion:
        -   "If this implementation is successful, who is it successful for?"
5.  Discuss Harms for each stakeholder
    -   Use the following questions to facilitate a discussion:
        -   "Who is directly affected by the implementation being successful for the central user / beneficiary?"
        -   "If the implementation is successful for the core user, how does the problem space change for the other stakeholders in the map?"
