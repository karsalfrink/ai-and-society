# Homework: Reflect on Readings

## Background

You are assigned readings throughout this course. The readings cover subjects including design, AI and ethics. Each week, you are asked to reflect on your readings, to help you get the most out of the material, and be properly prepared for next week's course. 

## Learning Objectives

After completing this activity you will have gained a deeper understanding of this week's readings, and will have summarized the core ideas in the papers in your own words, so that you can work with them in the course going forward.

## Instructions

-   In your personal notebook, create an entry for each of the questions below, with an answer to the question in your own words.
-   Questions for Bowles (2020)
    1.  The author criticises the lean startup "ideology". Name one specific problem that they think is caused by Lean.
    2.  The author also sees issues with traditional user-centred design. Again, name one specific issue with UCD according to Bowles.
    3.  The author mentions a number of recommendations for making product management more ethically responsible. Which of his recommendations could you apply in your own work in this course, and beyond?
-   Questions for Hill (2018)
    1.  The paper talks about "strategic design". How would you summarise this idea?
    2.  The paper argues for the use of strategic design in what we in this course call urban AI. How would you summarise this argument?
    3.  The paper gives a number of examples of strategic design projects that are aimed at urban AI. Select one example and summarise what the project is about.
    4.  For the example you selected, also answer the question why it is an example of strategic design.

## Product

The result of this activity is a collection of notes, each with a summary of one idea in the assigned readings, described in your own words, captured in your personal notebook.

## Follow-up

You will use the ideas generated in this way in next week's session's activities.
