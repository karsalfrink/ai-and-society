### About
This 6 EC master elective course ran in Q3 of the 2021/2022 academic year at TU Delft faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. It was offered to master students of all TU Delft programs.
The course was developed over several iterations by Kars Alfrink under supervision of Gerd Kortuem.
Previous versions were taught in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021.
We thank our students for engaging with the material and helping us improve it, and our collaborators over the years for their contributions: Thijs Turel, Tessa Steenkamp, Evangelos Niforatos, Hiram Rodriguez, James Broadhead, and Denis Bulygin.
