# Course Structure

Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, the course will be taught on campus.

Group work will happen in Miro boards, provided by the course team.

Informal communication will happen on the course Teams. 

The course is built up out of lectures, group workshops, individual readings, and the occasional individual homework activity. Topics covered include AI as a technology, ethical issues of AI, and strategic, large-scale design approaches. 

Our Tuesday morning and afternoon sessions always follow the same format: 

- Opening
- Lecture and a workshop (sometimes in reverse order)
- Discussion
- Closing

Discussion are informed by questions and comments submitted using a form during workshops and lectures.

There will be ample time for breaks throughout the sessions.
