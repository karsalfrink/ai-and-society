## Background

You've created product visions for you concept. You might be wondering wether they are any good. This activity is about documenting the concept in such a way that your instructors can provide you with some feedback, asynchronously.

## Learning Objectives

## Instructions

Record a brief video in which you describe your design concept. We suggest simply firing up your video conferencing platform of choice, screen-sharing your Miro board, and recording yourself as you describe the concept. Don't worry about production values. Keep it short. If there are specific things you are unsure about, call them out so we can direct our feedback accordingly.

## Product

## Follow-up

We will review the video, record our feedback, and share it with you before the start of next week's session.
