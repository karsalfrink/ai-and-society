# Workshop: Ideate Visions of Responsible Urban AI

## Background

You've created prototype datasets and models, and you've learned about strategic and responsible design. It is time to take these elements and develop your design concept further. This activity is aimed at ideating one or more product visions of responsible urban AI, inspired by your workshop explorations and learnings from the readings and lectures.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment you will be able to ideate visions for responsible urban AI grounded in an understanding of the technology and ethical theory.

## Instructions

-   Brainstorm / ideate 1-3 product visions inspired by the prototype datasets you created in the previous workshop. How you go about this exactly is up to you. At this stage, more is better, so if you're feeling confident, try shooting for 5-10.
-   Use the provided canvas to capture the essence of each vision on your Miro board, and the rationale behind it.
-   Reflect on the visions created. Answer these questions for the overall results:
    1.  Would you say these ideas are examples of *strategic design*? Do they involve thinking at both the individual and the city scale? Why?
    2.  Would you say these ideas are examples of *ethical/responsible design*? Do they address specific values, and can you make an argument for why these designs are desirable, and to whom?

Finished early? Want to do more? Bored? Consider also doing the following:

-   Add a quick sketch to each vision that illustrates the human experience of the system somehow. 

## Product

The outcome of this activity is captured on your miro board, in the form of: 

-   One completed canvas per vision created
-   Two notes, one for each answer to the two reflection questions

## Follow-up

In the plenary session after the workshop we will discuss the outcomes of this activity.

One of these visions will be the basis for your continued design work towards the group assignment.
