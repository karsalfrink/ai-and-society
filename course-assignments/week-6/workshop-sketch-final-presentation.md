# Workshop: Sketch final presentation

## Background

So far, we've been focusing on doing the hard work of designing a responsible urban AI system. This activity in stead focuses on how to present your design to an outside audience. It also serves the purpose of letting you begin preparing for the final presentation of your design.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this activity you will be able to develop a storyline for a presentation of a responsible urban AI system.

## Instructions

On your Miro board, sketch out your final presentation in the form of a storyboard:

-   Create about 10 frames, each representing one slide in your future presentation deck
-   In each frame put a sketch or a placeholder image of how you will visually communicate the point of that slide
-   Underneath each frame briefly state (1-3 sentences) what the point of the slide will be (your speaker notes)
-   Try to create a smooth narrative taking your audience from beginning to end, so play around with the ordering and pay close attention to the transitions between the slides
-   For the content, refer to the list below to ensure you are hitting the essential elements, but feel free to include additional things 

## Product

When you've completed this activity you will have a storyboard that sketches out your final presentation. The presentation should cover the following aspects, as well as anything else you consider necessary to support your story:

-   **Problem description & value proposition:** What business goals and user needs is your responsible urban AI system trying to support?
-   **Stakeholders:** Who are the various major groups of people either directly or indirectly impacted by your system?
-   **Dataset:** What kinds of data does your system use? Where does that data come from?
-   **Model:** What prediction or classification task is your system performing on the basis of incoming new data?
-   **Street-level experience:** How do citizens encounter your system at street-level? What "touchpoints" do they experience directly or indirectly, what do those look like?
-   **Contestability:** What does the contestability loop look like (1) at use-time and (2) at design-time?

The presentation your are sketching out should take about 10 minutes at most.

## Follow-up

You will use the outcome of this activity in the next workshop, which is all about peer feedback. This sketch is also the starting point for your final presentation.
