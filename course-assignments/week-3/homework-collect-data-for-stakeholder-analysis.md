# Homework: Collect Data for Stakeholder Analysis

## Background
While developing a design concept, it is important to collect information: about your users, the context, competitors, or reference products. With more information, a designer can better understand a design situation and make better decisions about the product.

## Learning Objectives
In this home assignment, you'll get some practice and learn about hints on how to look for information about the context for your envisioned system.

## Instructions
1.  Decide what problem/idea / envisioned system you want to focus on
2.  Think about what you want to know before designing a solution
    -   Some examples:
        -   What is my main problem / idea / envisioned system?
        -   Who are my stakeholders? How can I find them?
        -   Is there a precedent? How did it go?
        -   What are possible changes I expect to observe?
3.  Use search engine to find information:
    -   "Grey literature", e.g. policy documents published on [amsterdam.nl](https://www.amsterdam.nl/)
    -   News pieces, e.g. [Parool](https://www.parool.nl/), [AT5](https://www.at5.nl/)
    -   Academic search engines, e.g. Scopus, Google Scholar
    -   Social media, e.g. <https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-advanced-search>
4.  How to find useful sources:
    -   Put yourself in others' shoes. How would you name your article as an author presenting your solution? How would name an article with the analysis of consequences?
    -   Put yourself in others' shoes. How would you describe your situation if you'd be unhappy with the solution? For different stakeholders, it'll be different situations and different words. 
    -   You cannot anticipate covering 100% of cases but try to think about as many different cases as possible. You're looking for variety, not an estimate in numbers.

## Product
A collection of materials with information relevant to your project. Especially, focus on finding stakeholders and potential effects your envisioned system will have on them.

## Follow-up
You'll use these materials in stakeholder analysis workshop during week 4.
