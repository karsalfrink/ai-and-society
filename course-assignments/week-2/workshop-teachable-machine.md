# Workshop: Teachable Machine

## Background

Designers need to develop a first-hand understanding of the material properties of machine learning. This activity is about exploring this technology without the need to do any programming.

## Learning Objectives

After this activity you will be able to create a machine learning model using Google Teachable Machine that is able to classify images based on samples you have collected and labelled yourself.

## Instructions

### Step 1

-   Go to Google Teachable Machine: [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image)
-   Create a new image project
-   Upload the labelled images from the training dataset provided
-   Train the model
-   Preview the model by uploading a couple of images from the same dataset
-   Reflect on the results. How does the model perform? Is it what you expected? Why do you think it behaves as it does?

### Step 2

If you have time, also do the following:

-   Re-use the training set from step 1, or collect new images yourself,
-   Train your model
-   Upload the model to the cloud
-   Make note of the URL
-   On your smartphone, go to <https://kind.io.tudelft.nl/teachable-machine-viewer/>
    -   On iOS, make sure you use Chrome rather than Safari
-   Insert the URL for the model you just saved to the cloud
-   Walk around (go outside if you like) and point the phone camera at objects you think it should be classifying
-   Again, reflect on the results. How it performs, why it behaves the way it does, etc.

## Product

The outcome of the activity is a trained model, and some notes on your reflections.

## Follow-up

We will discuss your reflections in the plenary session later in the day.
