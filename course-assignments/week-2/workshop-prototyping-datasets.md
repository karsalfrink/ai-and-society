# Workshop: Prototyping Datasets

## Background

As part of week 1's homework, you've collected a dataset for inspirational purposes. In this exercise you will analyze the images your group has collected, and take a first stab at ordering them in a variety of ways. This is sometimes called "material exploration". If we think of data as a design material, we should explore its properties to know what we can and cannot expect from it.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment you will be able to explore and analyse image datasets in such a way that they can subsequently be used to work with in a design process.

## Instructions

-   Upload the individual sets of images to a new corner on your Miro board
-   Look at the images together and discuss what they show
-   Selecting a sample from all of the images, create 3-5 clusters of about 8 images each.
    -   Write a descriptive label on a note on top of each cluster -- a candidate class for a classifier
    -   Write a theme on a note for the collection of clusters -- basically, what the resulting model would be used for
    -   Repeat this step two more times, for a total of three *sets* of clusters, each around a particular theme
-   Fill out and attach a minimal datasheet to each prototype dataset

## Product

The outcome of this exercise are three prototype datasets, each consisting of 3-5 clusters labeled clusters, an overall theme, and a minimal datasheet, captured on your group's Miro board.

## Follow-up

We will discuss the outcomes of the workshop in the plenary after the workshop.
