# Workshop: Contestability at Design Time

## Background

Contestability of ML systems can happen during use-time and design-time. In this workshop we focus on the latter. How can we allow for adversarial participation from citizens in the design and development process of your responsible urban AI system? Design-time contestability is important because it is pro-active and forward-looking. Use-time contestability is only able to respond to harms once they have already happened.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this activity you will be able to create a map of an ML pipeline specific to a particular design challenge, and you will be able to include a contestability loop in this map that enables contestability at design-time.

## Instructions

You can use the attached diagram as a scaffold for this exercise by placing it on your Miro board and working on top of it.

On your Miro board, create a new area where you can map out your system's **ML pipeline** in the form of a flowchart, consisting of the following steps:

1.  Problem definition: What specific task is the model supposed to accomplish?
2.  Data wrangling: What data is collected? Where does it come from? What metrics are used to evaluate data quality?
3.  Modeling: What type of model is used? What metrics are used to evaluate model quality?
4.  Deployment: Where does the model go? What larger system does it become a part of? In other words: How is it used in the real world?
5.  Feedback: What signals are used to determine the model's real-world performance? What data is collected to improve its performance?

Next, add a section to the flowchart that captures what efforts are made to make things **transparent**:

-   Technical transparency: Which key elements of the dataset and model need to be made public to enable contestability?
-   Procedural transparency: Which key decisions (made by system designers & developers) need to be made public to enable contestability?
-   Connect these elements with the steps of your pipeline.

Finally, add a section that captures the **participatory methods** put in place to enable contestability:

-   Stakeholders: Which parties should be made part of this participatory process? Do citizens need to participate directly, or will you invite civil society organisations to represent citizens? How will you select citizens, or representative bodies?
-   Problem: Which aspect(s) of the ML pipeline should these stakeholders participate in? Why?
-   Process: What rules and structures should govern the participatory process?
-   Evaluation: How will you determine the participatory method is achieving its goals?

## Product

Upon completion of this exercise you will have created a map of your Miro board of your system's machine learning pipeline, including a design-time contestability loop.

## Follow-up

We will discuss your findings and experiences with this workshop in the plenary discussion later in the day.
