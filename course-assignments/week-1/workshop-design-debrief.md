# Workshop: Design Debrief

## Background

One of the two main assignments that runs through this course is a design project. This activity is intended to begin the process of engaging with the design brief, and developing your own understanding of it.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this activity you will be able to begin the design process, because you have restated the design brief in your own terms.

## Instructions

-   Refer to the design concept assignment, as well as the Contestable AI by Design poster
-   Create a blank collaborative document in your Miro -- you can use the "notes" feature for this if you like
-   Read the design concept assignment, and look at the the poster
-   Summarize both documents in your own words, in the Miro note
-   Make sure to cover the following elements:
    -   Background: what is the project about, what is its context?
    -   Objective: What is the outcome the project aims for?
    -   Success criteria: How will the achievement of the project aims be measured?
    -   Stakeholders: Who are the groups of people that are directly or indirectly affected and/or involved in the project?
    -   Requirements: Which needs, wants and conditions should the end result satisfy?
    -   Deliverables: What outcomes should the design project deliver?

## Product

A restated design brief (aka "debrief") as a note in Miro.

## Follow-up

You will use the debrief as a starting point for the design project. We will discuss your debrief in the plenary following this workshop.
