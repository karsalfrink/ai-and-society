# Assessment

The courses consist of a balanced mix of group work and individual work:

- **Group work:** Groups of up to four students will work as a design team to develop a concept for a responsible AI service for the Municipality of Amsterdam. Final concepts will be presented to a panel of experts on the last day of the course.
- **Individual work:** Students will independently study the provided course materials, do homework assignments to prepare for workshops, contribute to group work and at the end of the course deliver a written paper.

Final course deliverables:

- **Group work:** A final design concept.
- **Individual work:** A written paper that provides a critical reflection on the design concept and provides a convincing argumentation how the design concept achieves the design goals, creates value for societal stakeholders and how it responds to ethical issues raised by AI.

Grading is 100% based on the individual paper.

Grading criteria include:

- Clarity of the argumentation
- Strength of the argumentation
- Depths of the exploration of critical design issues
- Consistency of argumentation with the design concepts
- Effective use of supporting literature
- The rubric used for grading the paper is attached.
