# Course Information

## Course Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being adopted at an increasing pace by companies, public organisations and government. It creates new business opportunities and is seen as a powerful tool to address key societal challenges such as health and sustainability. However, AI empowers those who understand how to harness this new technology and it potentially disadvantages those who don't have the skills, knowledge and know-how to understand or shape it.

Fundamentally, AI is a technology that allows us to automate decisions that normally would have been done by people or organisations. AI decides which news is important, who should get a loan, and what medical treatment might be most promising. In that sense, AI affects all of us, whether we realise it or not. In a wider sense, AI affects all of society. This raises fundamental question:

- How should AI be used, for what purpose? And who decides this?
- How can we ensure that AI is used in a responsible way? And who gets to decide what responsibility means?

You are training to become a designer. As a designer it is highly likely that sometime during your career you will be involved in the design and development of an AI-powered product or service and that you will make design decisions that affect a wide range of people. Thus, these questions become your questions:

- How do you as a designer decide how AI should be used and for what purpose?
- How do you as a designer ensure that AI is used in a responsible way?
- And what is your understanding of "responsible AI"?

To answer these questions, designers need to expand their repertoire of tools and methods. This is what AI & Society is about: to equip you with the technical foundation, ethical concepts and design framework to analyse the issues raised by AI, to design responsible AI products and services, and to make convincing arguments about the value and impact of your designs.

This course focuses on the use of AI by the Municipality of Amsterdam. The Municipality of Amsterdam is not only at the forefront in employing digital technologies but also a strong proponent of the responsible use of AI.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives focus on the development of research and design competencies with respect to AI and society.

After completing the course, students are able to:

- combine research literature from design, technology and social sciences to develop a theoretical understanding of AI in society
- explain critical issues of AI with respect to fairness, accountability and trust
- explain how technology, social and governance issues intersect in AI systems
- analyse AI case studies with respect to likely outcomes and impacts on societal stakeholders
- apply design thinking and design methods to tackle critical issues of AI on the level of technology, people, organisations, and society.

## Course Structure

Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, the course will be taught on campus.

Group work will happen in Miro boards, provided by the course team.

Informal communication will happen on the course Teams. 

The course is built up out of lectures, group workshops, individual readings, and the occasional individual homework activity. Topics covered include AI as a technology, ethical issues of AI, and strategic, large-scale design approaches. 

Our Tuesday morning and afternoon sessions always follow the same format: 

- Opening
- Lecture and a workshop (sometimes in reverse order)
- Discussion
- Closing

Discussion are informed by questions and comments submitted using a form during workshops and lectures.

There will be ample time for breaks throughout the sessions.

## Assessment

The courses consist of a balanced mix of group work and individual work:

- **Group work:** Groups of up to four students will work as a design team to develop a concept for a responsible AI service for the Municipality of Amsterdam. Final concepts will be presented to a panel of experts on the last day of the course.
- **Individual work:** Students will independently study the provided course materials, do homework assignments to prepare for workshops, contribute to group work and at the end of the course deliver a written paper.

Final course deliverables:

- **Group work:** A final design concept.
- **Individual work:** A written paper that provides a critical reflection on the design concept and provides a convincing argumentation how the design concept achieves the design goals, creates value for societal stakeholders and how it responds to ethical issues raised by AI.

Grading is 100% based on the individual paper.

Grading criteria include:

- Clarity of the argumentation
- Strength of the argumentation
- Depths of the exploration of critical design issues
- Consistency of argumentation with the design concepts
- Effective use of supporting literature
- The rubric used for grading the paper is attached.
